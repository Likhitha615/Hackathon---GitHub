# 🎯 Dynamic Test Generation from GitHub Issues - Hackathon Solution

This project demonstrates **AI-powered dynamic test generation** that fetches GitHub issues and automatically creates test cases based on the issue requirements.

## 🚀 **What Makes This Special**

- ✅ **Fetches Real GitHub Issues** via API
- ✅ **Parses Requirements Dynamically** from issue descriptions
- ✅ **Generates Tests Automatically** based on content
- ✅ **Adapts to Any Issue Format** - no hardcoded tests
- ✅ **Perfect for Hackathons** - shows AI innovation

## 🧪 **Dynamic Test Generation Features**

### **Intelligent Requirement Parsing**
- Extracts "User should..." statements from issues
- Automatically identifies URLs from issue descriptions
- Categorizes requirements into test types

### **Smart Test Type Detection**
- 🔐 **Authentication Tests** (login, sign-in requirements)
- 🧭 **Navigation Tests** (menu navigation, page access)
- 🔑 **Functionality Tests** (password generation, form submission)
- 🔢 **Validation Tests** (input validation, field requirements)
- ❌ **Error Handling Tests** (error scenarios, edge cases)

### **Adaptive Element Detection**
- Tries multiple selector strategies for each element
- Gracefully handles missing elements
- Continues testing even if some elements aren't found

## 📁 **Project Structure**

```
tests/
└── dynamic_issue_tests.spec.ts    # 🌟 Main dynamic test file
package.json                       # Dependencies and scripts
playwright.config.ts              # Multi-browser test configuration
README.md                         # This file
DYNAMIC_TESTING_GUIDE.md          # Detailed technical guide
```

## 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Start**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
npx playwright install

# 2. Run dynamic tests (the magic happens here!)
npx playwright test dynamic_issue_tests.spec.ts

# 3. Run with browser visible (perfect for demos)
npx playwright test dynamic_issue_tests.spec.ts --headed

# 4. Debug mode (step through the AI decisions)
npx playwright test dynamic_issue_tests.spec.ts --debug
```

## 🎬 **Live Demo Flow**

1. **📥 Fetches Issue**: Gets real GitHub issue via API
2. **🔍 Analyzes Content**: Parses requirements and extracts URL
3. **🧠 Generates Plan**: Determines what test types to create
4. **🚀 Executes Tests**: Runs dynamically generated test scenarios
5. **📊 Reports Results**: Shows which requirements were tested

## 🎯 **Sample Output**

```
🔄 Fetching GitHub Issue...
📋 Issue Title: QA Hackathon || Controller Management - Generate Password
👤 Author: Likhitha615
🌐 Extracted URL: https://e3d-s.ecolab.com/
📝 Found 5 requirements:
   1. User should successfully authenticate by login to E3D
   2. User should be able to navigate to Controller Management module
   3. User should be able to navigate and access Generate Password section
   4. User should be able to Generate Password only after serial number is entered
   5. User should be able to see error if no serial number is entered

🎯 Will generate the following test types:
   1. authentication
   2. navigation
   3. password-generation
   4. validation
   5. error-handling

🚀 Executing 5 dynamically generated test scenarios...
